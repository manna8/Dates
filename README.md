# ISO2-2022-A02-Testing-P1
First testing exercise of the theoretical work.
Done by Raul Moya Campillos and Maja Anna Swierk.

## Exercise
It is about writing and testing a method that, accepting a date type object, returns whether the
date belongs to a leap year. In case of negative numbers or letters are passed as arguments, an
exception must be thrown to indicate this situation. Consider the possibility of performing these
checks at constructor method level.
